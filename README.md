## Book Search Bar
This project consistes on a search bar that consumes the [Penguin Random House book search API](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.biz/webservices/rest/) in order provide results acording to the users input. The component fetches images fom Amazon that fit each result, while providing direct links to buy each product in Amazon. It has been developed using React Redux and styled-components.

##### To ensure the proper execution of this app, I recommend using [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), together with an extension that enables performance of [cross-domain Ajax requests in web applications](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/access-control-allow-origin/).
